//NOT RUN CODE IN MACHINE EVERYTIME TO CHECK TIME
//TIME TAKEN IS NOT TIME COMPLEXITY LIKE 2S,3S,6S
//TIME TAKEN CAN BE DEPENDENT ON DEVICE

//RATE AT WHICH TIME TAKEN INCREASES WRT TO INPUT SIZE
//THETHA IS RATE OF INCREASE IN GRAPH AND IT IS TIME COMPLEXITY ITSELF
// BIG-Oh Notation O() inside it you write time taken
// Big O is number of steps like in for loop first assigning, then comparing, then printing and then increment/decrement
//no need to manually count
//tc;worst case scenario, avoid constant, avoid lower values
// 5x3=15 increment, check, print for loop of 5  O(15), BUT THIS IS A NUMBER
// for loop upto N, then NX3=3N SO time complexity = O(3N)

//best case, avg case, worst case, when program takes least amount of time in code execution it is best case
// we donot consider constant as when talking of a million, a single integer dont hold any significance
// other notations than big O, are thetha and omega
